This season of motherhood is full of messy moments and we are all learning to navigate what it means to raise small children. When we meet, we talk about topics that are related to this stage of our lives. We talk about how to care for our kids. Our homes. And ourselves. We talk about how we can love our husbands well (if we are married… single moms are welcome as well!) We also talk about how friendships look different during this season and how we can make sure that we have vibrant friendships even with spit-up stains on our shirts and our eyes stinging from lack of sleep.","Lily Moms. We hope you’ll join us! No one should journey through this season alone."]}],[{"l":"Frequently asked questions","p":["Topic One","Did this and that be true?"]}]]
