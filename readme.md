## Lily Moms at Redeemer â›ª

Christian ministry that meets at Redeemer Church of Evans which supports and builds community among mothers of children from conception through kindergarten.

## Life in the Little Years

It fits us. This season of motherhood is full of messy moments and we are all learning to navigate what it means to raise small children. When we meet, we talk about topics that are related to this stage of our lives. We talk about how to care for our kids, our homes, famlies and ourselves.

We also talk about how friendships look different during this season and how we can make sure that we have vibrant friendships even with spit-up stains on our shirts and our eyes stinging from lack of ðŸ¥± sleep.

ðŸ’– We hope youâ€™ll join us! No one should journey through this season alone. If you have any questions please do reach out to us.
